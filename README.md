# University of Toronto Course Searcher
Currently, University of Toronto's course search page has basic searching functionality. This 
program was written to expand upon the currently search functionality. Additional to being able to search
for keyword and breadth, University of Toronto Course Searcher also gives the option to search for different level courses 
as well as certain page numbers. University of Toronto Course Searcher is a simple GUI that uses web crawler and web scraping functionality
to retrieve course information. University of Toronto Course Searcher searches for a maximum of 100 courses.

## Usage
To run this program, run main.py.

The user is able to search between keyword, breadth, and level courses. For example, to find 300 level
courses, the user can input 300 for level. To find breadth 5, The Physical and Mathematical Universes, courses
the user would input 5 into for breadth and press search.

Once the search has finished, the program will display all courses that meet the search specifications.
The user will also have the option to save the courses in a text file.
